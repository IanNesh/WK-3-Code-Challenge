# Flatdango
Week Three Code Challenge

## Description
For this challenge I'll be working on Flatdango.

Flatiron Movie Theater is open for business! I'll be building  an application, Flatdango, that allows a user to purchase movie tickets from the theater.
It also showcases the list of movies available to choose from and details about each movie.

## Getting started
In order to use this particular project one needs to have;
* A computer that runs on
 -linux
  -Mac OS



## Installments
Open a terminal on your computer and clone the repository 
        
        git@github.com:IanNesh/WK-3-Code-Challenge.git

Change the directory to the repository folder
        cd WK-3-Code-Challenge
Then open VS Code
        code .

## Running the tests
Install dependencies from npm json-server
    npm install -g json-server
Run npm start
Right click index.html and open the server
The web application has a list, to view a specific movie and buy tickets, click on the name of the movie
